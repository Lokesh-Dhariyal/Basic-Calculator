Calculator.js was the first js I wrote for this project which was only able to do one operation at a time and it was also not optimal.
(I was going with the flow, and did not planned how to do the calculation, and just tried to solve edge cases which were comming on after another)
Than I create another js file Basic.js in which I added a function(link : https://stackoverflow.com/a/16327230/27408055) for the calculations in which a string is solved and the output is displayed.
And also optimise the eventListener.

*Update* : The above link's function was not able to follow BODMAS as it was using a loop. So I Used the inbuilt function eval.
